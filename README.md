# Hi there, I'm Luís 👋

💻 Just an apprentice in the way of the clean code, still learning the Force of programming.
🚀 Loved technology since childhood — always dreamed of building fun and cool stuff but never challenged myself… until now.
✨ On a journey where bugs are just wild encounters, and every line of code is a step closer to evolving.
🎮 Constantly grinding XP to level up as a developer, because I will never stop trying to be the very best, like no one ever was.
🌌 May my curiosity be with me, always.
